# Background Music

Place your background music file here.

## Current Music
- **jazz_guitar_medley_78.mp3** (1.1MB) - Currently active

## Supported Formats
- **MP3** - Most common format ✓
- **OGG** - Recommended for games (better looping, smaller size)
- **WAV** - High quality (larger file size)

## How It Works
The game will automatically detect and play the first music file it finds in this directory (searches for .mp3, .ogg, then .wav files in that order).

## Tips
- For seamless looping, ensure your music file loops cleanly
- Current volume: Game starts at 30% volume
- File size: Keep under 10MB for faster loading
- Volume control: Click and drag the neon green volume bar in top-right corner

## To Change Music
Simply replace the existing file with your own music file (any .mp3, .ogg, or .wav file will work)
