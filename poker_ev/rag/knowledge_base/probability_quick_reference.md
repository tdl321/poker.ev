## SPR (Stack-to-Pot Ratio) Guidelines

| SPR Range | Situation | Hand Types to Play | Strategy |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|----------|
| 0-2 | Shallow/Committed | Strong made hands | Pot committed, hard to fold |
| 2-4 | Medium-shallow | Top pair+, strong draws | Cautious, pot control |
| 4-7 | Medium | All strong hands | Balanced approach |
| 7-13 | Deep | Implied odds hands | Set mining, drawing hands |
| 13+ | Very deep | Speculative hands | High implied odds plays |

## Equity Needed for Common Situations

### Set Mining

**Minimum SPR**: 15:1
**Implied odds needed**: ~12:1
**Flopping set**: 11.8%

**Example**:
- Call: $10
- Need to win: $120 (when you flop set)
- Opponent stack minimum: $150

### Flush Draw Call (Flop)

**Direct odds**: 36% equity, need <36% pot odds
**Minimum pot odds for call**: 2.8:1 (26%)

**Example**:
- Call: $40
- Pot minimum: $110

### OESD Call (Flop)

**Direct odds**: 32% equity, need <32% pot odds
**Minimum pot odds for call**: 3.1:1 (24%)

**Example**:
- Call: $30
- Pot minimum: $95

## Bluffing Break-Even Percentages

| Bet Size | Fold % Needed |
|----------|---------------|
| 1/4 pot | 20% |
| 1/3 pot | 25% |
| 1/2 pot | 33% |
| 2/3 pot | 40% |
| Pot | 50% |
| 1.5× pot | 60% |
| 2× pot | 67% |

**Formula**: Fold % = Bet / (Pot + Bet)

## Mental Math Shortcuts

### Quick Pot Odds

1. **Count the pot in bets**
   - Pot: $90, Bet: $30
   - Pot = 3 bets
   - Odds: 3:1 = 25%

2. **Half-pot bet always equals 3:1 (25%)**

3. **Pot-sized bet always equals 2:1 (33%)**

### Quick Equity Estimation

**Flop**: # of outs × 4 = equity %
**Turn**: # of outs × 2 = equity %

**For 15+ outs**: (# of outs × 3) + 8 = equity %

### Quick EV Estimation

**Profitable if**: Equity > Pot Odds %

**Example**:
- Pot odds: 25% (need to win 1 in 4)
- Your equity: 32% (win 1 in 3.1)
- **Call is profitable**

## Common Bet Sizes and Frequencies

### Optimal Bluffing Frequency

**Alpha (α)**: Ratio of bluffs to value bets

**Formula**: α = Pot / Bet

**Example**: Pot-sized bet
- α = 1 (one bluff for every value bet)
- Bluff: 50% of time
- Value: 50% of time

### Bet Sizing for Protection

**Question**: How much to bet to make flush draw fold?

**Their odds**: 9 outs = 18% on turn

**Your bet**: Make pot odds worse than 18%

**Example**:
- Pot: $100
- Need to bet >$122 to make them fold
- (They need $122 / ($100 + $122) = 55% equity, but only have 18%)

Actually, let me recalculate:
- They have 18% equity
- You want to charge them more than 18%
- Bet X such that: X / (100 + X + X) > 0.18
- X / (100 + 2X) > 0.18
- X > 0.18(100 + 2X)
- X > 18 + 0.36X
- 0.64X > 18
- X > $28

So you need to bet at least $28 to make them need >18% equity!

**EV**: (Win % × Win Amount) - (Lose % × Lose Amount)

**Bluff Break-Even**: Bet / (Pot + Bet)

**SPR**: Effective Stack / Pot
