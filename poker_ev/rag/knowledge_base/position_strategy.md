# Position Strategy in Texas Hold'Em

## Why Position Matters

**Position is power** in poker because:
1. You act last and have more information
2. You can control pot size
3. You can bluff more effectively
4. You can value bet thinner

## Table Positions

### Early Position (EP)
- **UTG (Under The Gun)**: First to act pre-flop
- **UTG+1**: Second to act
- **Characteristics**:
  - Worst position
  - 7-8 players act after you
  - Need strong hands to open

**Opening Range**: Top 10-15% of hands
- Premium pairs: AA, KK, QQ, JJ, TT
- Strong broadway: AK, AQ

### Middle Position (MP)
- **MP1, MP2**: Middle seats
- **HJ (Hijack)**: One seat before cutoff
- **Characteristics**:
  - Moderate position
  - 4-5 players act after you
  - Can open wider than EP

**Opening Range**: Top 20-25% of hands
- Add: 99-77, AJ, KQ, suited connectors

### Late Position (LP)
- **CO (Cutoff)**: One seat before button
- **BTN (Button)**: Dealer position - BEST POSITION
- **Characteristics**:
  - Excellent position
  - Act last post-flop
  - Maximum information

**Opening Range**: Top 35-45% of hands
- Add: All pairs, suited aces, connected cards
- Button can play almost any two cards in right situations

### Blinds
- **SB (Small Blind)**: Worst post-flop position
- **BB (Big Blind)**: Second worst position
- **Characteristics**:
  - Already invested money
  - Act first post-flop
  - Defend based on pot odds

**Defending Range**:
- BB: Defend ~30-40% vs. single raise
- SB: Defend ~20-30% (worse position)

## Position-Based Strategy

### Early Position Strategy

**Pre-Flop**:
- Open-raise 2.5-3x BB with premium hands
- Fold marginal hands (avoid trouble)
- Rarely limp (shows weakness)

**Post-Flop**:
- Play straightforward
- Bet strong hands for value
- Be cautious with marginal holdings
- Face aggression → fold unless very strong

### Middle Position Strategy

**Pre-Flop**:
- Open wider range than EP
- 3-bet premium hands
- Call with speculative hands if price is right

**Post-Flop**:
- C-bet more frequently
- Can bluff occasionally
- Semi-bluff with draws
- Fold to aggression unless you have equity

### Late Position Strategy

**Pre-Flop**:
- STEAL BLINDS: Open 30-50% of hands on button
- 3-bet light against weak opponents
- Call with speculative hands (implied odds)

**Post-Flop**:
- Aggression is key
- Bet for value with marginal hands
- Bluff weak opponents
- Control pot size with medium hands
- Float (call to bluff later) with position

### Blind Strategy

**From Small Blind**:
- Complete with good hands vs. weak BB
- 3-bet premium hands
- Fold most marginal hands (bad position)

**From Big Blind**:
- Defend against steals (pot odds!)
- Check-raise bluff occasionally
- Lead out (donk bet) rarely with specific hands
- Play fit-or-fold on many flops

## Position-Specific Plays

### Squeeze Play (Re-raise from blinds)
- **When**: Opener from LP + caller(s)
- **Why**: They likely have weak ranges
- **Hands**: Strong hands or good bluffing hands

### Isolation Raise
- **When**: Weak player limps
- **Why**: Play heads-up in position
- **Hands**: Wide range in position

### Float
- **When**: Opponent c-bets, you have position
- **Why**: Take away pot on turn
- **Hands**: Any two cards with right opponent

### Probe Bet (IP)
- **When**: Opponent checks flop out of position
- **Why**: Take initiative, build pot, or bluff
- **Hands**: Made hands and draws

## Position and Pot Size

### In Position (IP)
- **Control pot size**: Can check back to keep pot small
- **Value bet thinner**: Can bet medium hands for value
- **Bluff more**: Can bluff multiple streets

### Out of Position (OOP)
- **Less control**: Harder to control pot size
- **Check-raise or bet**: Need to be more straightforward
- **Fewer bluffs**: Riskier to bluff

## Common Position Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Open too wide from EP
- **Problem**: Get 3-bet with weak hands
- **Fix**: Tighten up in early position

### Mistake 2: Fold too much from blinds
- **Problem**: Opponents steal with impunity
- **Fix**: Defend according to pot odds

### Mistake 3: Not aggressive enough in LP
- **Problem**: Missing steal opportunities
- **Fix**: Raise 40%+ from button

### Mistake 4: Same range regardless of position
- **Problem**: Predictable and exploitable
- **Fix**: Adjust opening range by position

## Adjusting for Opponent Position

### When Opponent is Out of Position
- **Bet more often**: They're at disadvantage
- **Bluff more**: Harder for them to call
- **Wider value range**: Can bet thinner

### When Opponent is In Position
- **Play more cautiously**: They have advantage
- **Check-raise more**: Balance your checking range
- **Fewer bluffs**: They can float and bluff later
