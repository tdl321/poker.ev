- [ ] Understand break-even percentages

### Required Reading
1. **Rule of 2 and 4** - Complete guide
2. **Pot Odds Tutorial** - Complete guide
3. **Quick Reference** - Pot odds tables

### Key Concepts

#### 1. Rule of 2 and 4
Master the conversion:

- **Turn** (1 card to come): Outs × 2
- **15+ outs**: (Outs × 3) + 8

#### 2. Pot Odds Formula
```
Pot Odds % = Call Amount / (Pot + Call Amount)
```

Practice until automatic!

#### 3. Decision Rule
**If Equity > Pot Odds → Call**
**If Equity < Pot Odds → Fold**

### Practice Exercises
- [ ] Convert outs to equity for 20 scenarios
- [ ] Calculate pot odds in 20 situations
- [ ] Make call/fold decisions in 30 spots

### Drills

- 8 outs on turn: 16%
- 12 outs on flop: 48%
- 15 outs on flop: 53%

**Drill 2: Pot Odds**
Calculate pot odds:
- Pot $80, bet $40
- Pot $60, bet $20
- Pot $100, bet $100
- Pot $50, bet $75

**Drill 3: Complete Decision**
Full decision process:
1. Count outs
2. Convert to equity
3. Calculate pot odds
4. Compare and decide

Do this for 10 different scenarios.

### Success Criteria

## Level 4: Value (Intermediate-Advanced)

### Learning Objectives
- [ ] Calculate expected value (EV)
- [ ] Understand implied odds
- [ ] Estimate future value realistically
- [ ] Consider reverse implied odds
- [ ] Factor in fold equity

### Required Reading
1. **Expected Value Mastery** - Complete guide
2. **Implied Odds Intuition** - Complete guide
3. **Common Probability Mistakes** - EV and implied odds sections

### Key Concepts

#### 1. EV Formula
```
EV = (Win % × Win Amount) - (Lose % × Lose Amount)
```

#### 2. Implied Odds Estimation
Ask yourself:
- How much is left in stacks?
- Will opponent pay off when I hit?
- Is my hand disguised?
- What's my position?

#### 3. SPR (Stack-to-Pot Ratio)
```
SPR = Effective Stack / Pot
```

**Guidelines**:
- SPR 15+: Great for set mining
- SPR 7-13: Good for drawing hands
- SPR 2-6: Medium implied odds
- SPR 0-2: Poor implied odds

#### 4. Fold Equity
```
EV(bet) = (Fold % × Pot) + (Call % × Equity × Total Pot) - (Call % × (1 - Equity) × Bet)
```

### Practice Exercises
- [ ] Calculate EV for 20 different decisions
- [ ] Estimate implied odds in 15 situations
- [ ] Identify reverse implied odds spots
- [ ] Calculate fold equity in aggressive plays

### Drills

**Drill 1: EV Calculation**
Calculate EV for:
1. Call $50, pot $100, 30% equity
2. Call $40, pot $80, 40% equity
3. Call $75, pot $150, 25% equity

**Drill 2: Implied Odds**
Estimate future value:
1. Set mining: flop set, opponent has overpair
2. Flush draw: hit flush, opponent has top pair
3. Gutshot: complete straight, board is paired

**Drill 3: Fold Equity**
Calculate EV of bluffing:
1. Pot $100, bet $75, opponent folds 50%, your equity 0%
2. Pot $80, bet $60, opponent folds 40%, your equity 30%

### Success Criteria
✅ Can calculate EV quickly
✅ Realistically estimates implied odds
✅ Recognizes reverse implied odds situations
✅ Understands how fold equity affects decisions
✅ Uses SPR to guide decisions

### Next Level
Once you're comfortable with advanced calculations, move to Level 5.

## Common Plateaus and How to Overcome

### Plateau 1: "I can't count outs fast enough"
**Solution**: Use flashcards. Practice 10 minutes daily for 2 weeks.

### Plateau 2: "Pot odds calculations take too long"
**Solution**: Memorize common bet sizes. Use the "count in bets" method.

### Plateau 3: "I know the math but can't apply it"
**Solution**: Start with online poker where you have time. Gradually speed up.

### Plateau 4: "I make correct decisions but still lose"
**Solution**: Focus on long-term EV, not results. Review more hands.

## Resources for Continued Learning

### Practice Tools
- Hand history review software
- Equity calculators
- Probability quizzes (see practice_problems.md)

### Recommended Practice
1. **Daily**: 10-minute routine
2. **Weekly**: Review 20 hands you played
3. **Monthly**: Retake assessment tests

### Community
- Discuss hands in forums
- Get coached on specific leaks
- Teach concepts to others (best learning method!)

## Final Tips

1. **Consistency beats intensity**: 10 minutes daily > 2 hours weekly
2. **Active practice beats passive reading**: Do the drills!
3. **Review mistakes**: Every error is a learning opportunity
4. **Be patient**: Mastery takes months, not days
5. **Apply immediately**: Use new concepts in your next session
