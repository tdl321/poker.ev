# Probability Fundamentals for Poker

## Introduction

Understanding probability in poker doesn't require advanced math. This guide will teach you the fundamentals using intuitive, real-world examples that will help you make better decisions at the table.

## The Basics: Fractions, Decimals, and Percentages

In poker, we express probabilities in three ways:

### Fractions
- **Example**: 1/4 means "1 out of 4 times"
- **Poker context**: If you have a 1/4 chance of hitting your flush, you'll complete it about once every four times you're in this situation

### Decimals
- **Example**: 0.25 is the same as 1/4
- **Poker context**: Rarely used at the table, but important for calculations

### Percentages
- **Example**: 25% is the same as 1/4 or 0.25
- **Poker context**: Most commonly used format. "I have a 25% chance of hitting my flush"

**Quick conversion**: To go from fraction to percentage, divide the top by the bottom and multiply by 100.
- 1/4 = 1 ÷ 4 = 0.25 = 25%

## Thinking "Out of 100 Hands"

The most intuitive way to understand poker probabilities is to think in terms of **"out of 100 hands"**.

### Example 1: Being Dealt Pocket Aces
- **Probability**: 0.45% or about 1 in 221 hands
- **Out of 100 hands**: You'll be dealt AA less than once in 100 hands
- **Intuitive framing**: If you play 200 hands, expect to see pocket aces about once

### Example 2: Being Dealt Any Pocket Pair
- **Probability**: 5.9% or about 1 in 17 hands
- **Out of 100 hands**: You'll be dealt a pocket pair about 6 times
- **Intuitive framing**: On average, you'll see a pocket pair once every 17 hands

### Example 3: Flopping a Set with a Pocket Pair
- **Probability**: 11.8% or about 1 in 8.5 hands
- **Out of 100 hands**: When you have a pocket pair, you'll flop a set about 12 times
- **Intuitive framing**: If you play pocket pairs 100 times, expect to flop a set roughly 12 times

## The Coin Flip Analogy

### 50/50 Spots in Poker
A "coin flip" or "race" in poker means each player has roughly a 50% chance of winning.

**Common coin flip situations**:
1. **A♠ K♥ vs 8♦ 8♣** (overcards vs pocket pair)
   - Pocket pair: ~53%
   - Overcards: ~47%
   - This is close enough to 50/50 to call it a "race"

2. **A♠ K♠ vs Q♥ J♥** (higher cards vs lower suited connectors)
   - AK: ~58%
   - QJ suited: ~42%
   - Not quite a coin flip, but closer than you might think

**Why this matters**: When you're in a coin flip situation, you're not a favorite or an underdog—you're breaking even in terms of equity. This affects whether you should commit all your chips.

## Basic Counting in Poker

Understanding the deck composition is essential:

### Deck Composition
- **Total cards**: 52
- **Ranks**: 13 (A, K, Q, J, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2)
- **Suits**: 4 (♠ Spades, ♥ Hearts, ♦ Diamonds, ♣ Clubs)
- **Cards per rank**: 4 (one of each suit)
- **Cards per suit**: 13 (one of each rank)

### Simple Probability Calculations

**Question**: What are the chances of being dealt pocket aces?

**Step-by-step**:
1. First card is an ace: 4/52 (4 aces in 52 cards)
2. Second card is also an ace: 3/51 (3 aces left in 51 cards)
3. Multiply: (4/52) × (3/51) = 12/2,652 = 1/221
4. Convert to percentage: 1 ÷ 221 = 0.0045 = **0.45%**

**Question**: What are the chances of being dealt any pocket pair?

**Step-by-step**:
1. First card can be anything: 52/52 = 1
2. Second card must match the first card's rank: 3/51
3. Multiply: 1 × (3/51) = 3/51 = 1/17
4. Convert to percentage: 1 ÷ 17 = 0.059 = **5.9%**

**Question**: What are the chances of being dealt suited cards?

**Step-by-step**:
1. First card can be anything: 52/52 = 1
2. Second card must match the first card's suit: 12/51 (12 cards of that suit left)
3. Multiply: 1 × (12/51) = 12/51
4. Convert to percentage: 12 ÷ 51 = 0.235 = **23.5%**

## Key Concepts Summary

### 1. More Likely Than You Think
- Being dealt suited cards: 23.5% (almost 1 in 4)
- Flopping a pair when you have two unpaired cards: 32% (about 1 in 3)

### 2. Less Likely Than You Think
- Being dealt pocket aces: 0.45% (1 in 221)
- Flopping a flush when you have suited cards: 0.84% (1 in 118)

### 3. The Importance of "Roughly"
In poker, you don't need exact percentages. Understanding that something happens "about 1 in 4 times" or "roughly 25%" is sufficient for making good decisions.

## Practice Questions

### Beginner Level

1. **Convert these fractions to percentages**:
   - 1/2 = ?
   - 1/3 = ?
   - 1/5 = ?

2. **True or False**: If you have a 20% chance of winning, you'll win out of 100 times?

3. **Which is more likely**?
   a) Being dealt any pocket pair
   b) Being dealt suited cards

### Answers

1.
   - 1/2 = 50%
   - 1/3 = 33.3%
   - 1/5 = 20%

2. **True**: 20% means 20 out of 100 times

3. **b) Being dealt suited cards** (23.5%) is more likely than being dealt any pocket pair (5.9%)

## Next Steps

Once you understand these fundamentals, you're ready to learn about:
- **Calculating outs**: Counting cards that improve your hand
- **Equity**: Your share of the pot based on your win probability
- **Pot odds**: Comparing the pot size to the cost of your call

Understanding probability fundamentals gives you the foundation to calculate whether poker decisions are profitable in the long run.
